# Changelog

### v0.7.2 (NOT YET RELEASED)
* Additions
  * CX package manager:
    - Added a flag for setting a CX workspace. This flag overrides the environment variable .
	- Import statements are now aware of the possibility of importing libraries that are defined in a CX workspace.
	- If the user has not set a CXPATH through an environment variable or --cxpath flag, CX will use by default `~/cx` and create all the necessary subdirectories.
	- If the directory supplied by the user to be used as CXPATH does not contain the following subdirectories: `src/`, `pkg/` and `bin/`, CX will create these subdirectories.
* Changes
  * Removed cx-games as a module. It was just confusing as users would be
    redirected to an outdated version of the repo and the games are already
    mentioned in the README.

### v0.7.1 released 2019-07-26
* Additions
  * Added capability of storing heap objects in a CX chain's program state.
  * Added a function that prints information about the heap for debugging purposes (`debugHeap` in cx/utilities.go).
* Changes
  * Redesign of CX's garbage collector.
  * Changes to several functions that relied on allocating objects on the heap.
  * In previous versions of CX the data segment was living inside the heap segment. Now the data segment is properly separated from the heap segment.
  * Moved CX book sources to github.com/skycoin/cx-book. The releases and any code updates will be pushed to that repository.
    * The README file notifies the users about this change.

  * #286: Compilation error when struct field is named 'input' or 'output'

### v0.7.0 released 2019-06-15
* Additions
  * CX can now generate addresses to be used by CX chains.
  * New debug option --debug-lexer or -Dl to see which tokens that are
	returned by the lexer.
* Changes
  * Removed `cmd/cli`. The CX executable should now be used to generate CX chain addresses.
  * Running a CX chain with the --broadcast flag no longer runs the transaction code locally; it simply
	broadcasts the transaction code and it is run in the peer node to update the program state. If the user
	wants to test transaction code, the --transaction flag must be used.
  * Updated the style of the CX roadmap.
  * Changed max transaction size to 128 Mb. CX chains are storing their program state in two different unspent outputs in their skycoin fork. This means that if a CX program to be stored on a CX chain needs 64 Mb, then the CX chain will need at least a max transaction size of 128 Mb. This behavior needs to be corrected immediately in the next version of CX and the user needs a way to set these parameters via flags (they're hardcoded at the moment).
* Libraries
  * ...
* Fixed issues
  * #357: Error running cx in blockchain broadcast mode.
  * #360: Panic when package keyword is misspelled
  * #373: Error in address used to generate a CSRF token. Port was 6001 instead of 6421.
  * #388: Array fail on cx --blockchain.
  * #389: CX chains errors with big programs.
* Documentation
  * New file `documentation/BLOCKCHAIN-OVERVIEW.md` which describes the processes and modules involved in CX chains.
  * The blockchain tutorial
	[documentation/BLOCKCHAIN.md](https://github.com/skycoin/cx/blob/develop/documentation/BLOCKCHAIN.md)
	will be used to reflect the state in the CX source code (`develop` branch)
  * The blockchain tutorial in the
	[wiki](https://github.com/skycoin/cx/wiki/CX-Chains-Tutorial) will
	be used as a tutorial for the latest CX release.

    repositoryand adapted it to CX chains.
